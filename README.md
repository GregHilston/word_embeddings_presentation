# Word Embeddings Presentation

This repository was put together as a presentation both for Madwire Media and a local Fort Collins, Colorado Data Science meetup. This was put together by [Max Lei](https://github.com/mxlei01) and myself.

The files are as follows:

- word_embeddings.pdf / word_embeddings.pptx
  - The presentation itself
  - I'd start by reading through this
- word_embeddings.ipynb
  - The first notebook which walks through the simple examples layed out in the presentation
- creating_embeddings_and_sentiment_analysis.ipynb
  - The second notebook which shows how one can create their own word embeddings
  - Also shows sentiment analysis that can be done yourself
- word_embeddings_workbook.ipynb
  - The third and final notebook which is structured as a workbook to be gone through on your own
